#PSGeothermieAargau

This is the documentation repository for a sphinx gallery accompanying the [Pilot Study Geothermie Aargau](https://geg.ethz.ch/project-geothermal_aargau/).
The gallery is meant to lead through the open workflow from data compilation to heat-transport simulation using step-by-step examples.
