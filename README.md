This is the documentation repository for a sphinx gallery accompanying the [Pilot Study Geothermie Aargau](https://geg.ethz.ch/project-geothermal_aargau/).
The code written in this package comprises processing methods for an open-source workflow developed for this project. The project's aim is to study heat flow and subsurface temperature-distribution 
in a model-based stochastic approach. 
The gallery is meant to lead through the open workflow from data compilation to heat-transport simulation using step-by-step examples.  

## üåü Highlights

- Tutorial for leading through the developed workflow  
- Methods for creating input files for heat transport modeling in MOOSE or SHEMAT-Suite from GemPy Models
- Simple methods for calculating heat flow from temperature simulations
- Straight forward MonteCarlo rejection algorithm


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

A paragraph explaining your work, who you are, and why you made it.


### ‚úçÔ∏è Authors

The code and documentation was mainly developed by [Jan Niederau](https://github.com/Japhiolite) during his time at the [Geothermal Energy and Geofluids group](https://geg.ethz.ch)


## üöÄ Usage

*Show off what your software looks like in action! Try to limit it to one-liners if possible and don't delve into API specifics.*

```py
>>> import mypackage
>>> mypackage.do_stuff()
'Oh yeah!'
```


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Simple, understandable installation instructions!

```bash
pip install my-package
```

And be sure to specify any other minimum requirements like Python versions or operating systems.

*You may be inclined to add development instructions here, don't.*
