It is written in fortran and uses a finite differences scheme in a hexahedral grid.\nIn this example, we will load a heat transport simulation from the base POC model we created in \"Geological model creation and gravity simulation\". We will demonstrate methods contained \nin OpenWF for loading the result file, displaying the parameters it contains and how to visualize these parameters. Finally, we will calculate the conductive heat flow and plot it.\n"

That is, in an HDF5 file from SHEMAT-Suite, we have the dimensions [z,y,x], so here qz[z,y,x]. \n\nThe three variables now contain the heat flow in x, y, z direction for each cell in the model. Let's have a look at a horizontal slice through the model center and the heat flow in \nz-direction. Remembering the notation for directions, and seeing that in z-direction, we have 60 cells, the horizontal slice would reflect ``qz[29,:,:]``, i.e. all entries in x- and \ny-direction at index 29 of the z-direction. In the HDF5-file, we further count from the bottom, so ``qz[0,:,:]`` is the deepest slice, ``qz[-1,:,:]`` the shallowest.\n\n"
