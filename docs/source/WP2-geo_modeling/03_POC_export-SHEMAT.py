Create SHEMAT-Suite models
==========================
 
 With the MC ensemble of generated geological models stored in the respective lith-blocks, we can use them to create SHEMAT-Suite models for then doing 
 forward simulations of Heat- and Mass-transfer.

# load the base model
# -------------------
# For creating SHEMAT-Suite input files from the Monte Carlo Ensemble we created in :ref:`sphx_glr_examples_geo_modeling_02_POC_create-MC-ensemble.py` we load the base POC model, which was created
# in :ref:`sphx_glr_examples_geo_modeling_01_POC_generate-model.py`. As we want to have the topography also in the SHEMAT-Suite model later on, we will create a mask of the model topography, called
# `topo_mask`

# Load the MC-lithologies
# -----------------------
# Next, we load the lithology blocks created by the MC example and mask them by the topography

#%%
# The model topography is not only important for the geological model, i.e. cutting geology with topography to produce a geological map, but is also vital for later on heat transport simulations.
# Especially if a simulation should consider advective/convective heat transport, as these can be driven by the topography. Similarly, surface temperature correlates with altitute. 
# Hence, knowing topography is important, when we want to have a realistic top boundary condition for temperature in a model which includes topography. Usually, surface temperature is available from 
# meteorologic services. If, however, that is not the case, surface temperature as a function of altitude can be estimated from an average lapse rate $L$ (0.0065 K/m) and knowledge of temperature at 
# sea level.

# Set up the units for the SHEMAT-Suite model
# -------------------------------------------
# One core element of a SHEMAT-Suite Input file is the `# units` table. This table comprises the petrophysical parameters of the lithological units whose geometry is stored in the `# uindex` field.
# The following code shows an example of how set up the `# units` table as a dataframe to be then stored in a SHEMAT-Suite input file. 

# Load existing units of the geological model:
units = geo_model.surfaces.df[['surface', 'id']]
units

#%%
# Now we create a dictionary with values for important parameters of each of the 12 units:
# And join it with the existing units dataframe.

         'perm': np.array([1e-16, 1e-16, 1e-16, 1e-16, 1e-16, 1.0e-14, 1.0e-14, 1.0e-15, 1.0e-17, 1.0e-14, 1.0e-15, 1.0e-16]),

#%%
# So now, the `units` table looks like this:
units

# It is still missing the air component though. We have to add this, because the cells above the topography are
# assigned to a unit representing the air. For mimicking the long-wavelength radiation outward from the ground, we assign
# a high thermal conductivity to the air. If we were to assign a realistic low thermal conductivity, it would work as an insulator.

# Export to SHEMAT-Suite
# ----------------------
