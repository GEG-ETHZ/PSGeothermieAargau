Welcome the Pilot Study Geothermie Aargau!
==========================================

.. note::
   This project is under active development.

This documentation should serve as a step-by-step description of an open-source workflow
from data acquisition to geothermal reservoir modeling, which has been developed in a pilot project
at the GEG group at ETH Zurich together with swisstopo. 
One aim of the pilot project named "Pilot Study Geothermie Aargau", is to develop a reproducible and integrative
workflow, fullly open-source, for a model-based getohermal prospection. With good data situation, and a distinct heat-flow anomaly, the 
region around Brugg and Aargau in northern Switzerland poses a suited test area for this pilot study.
Using the developed workflow, we aim to model this heat-flow anomaly, aiming to simulate the underlying heat-transport processes yielding
heat-flow values of up to 140 mW/mÂ².
