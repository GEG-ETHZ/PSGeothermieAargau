Open WorkFlow Tutorial
================

Below are examples on the workflow developed in the project PS Aargau. The examples are divided in 4 successive steps. First, a geological model is created and its gravity signal is calculated
at defined locations of hypothetical measuring stations. Then, we vary the depth of the graben units and compute a small ensemble of 10 geological models, each with simulated gravity
at the specified locations. Then we transfer these ensemble to SHEMAT-Suite models for simulating the heat transport in each of the ensemble members. Then, we present some 
postprocessing of heat transport simulations carried out with `SHEMAT-Suite <https://git.rwth-aachen.de/SHEMAT-Suite/SHEMAT-Suite-open/-/wikis/home>`_ on the geological
models which were generated with GemPy. 
Finally, in an example we show an approach of conditioning the ensemble using simulated gravity and temeprature and their comparison to the "measured" quantities.
